        This means all the URLs now will be relative to the root of the application. So when we navaigate to "/list", the path "/list" will be appended to root UR and the complete URL will be as shown below. Notice "/list" is relative to the root URL.
        http://localhost:4200/list.

        if we are deploying our application in a sub-folder called "emp", then we set the base href element to /emp/ as shown below.
        <base href="/emp/">


        During development, if you want a different base path other than "/", simply execute the "ng serve" command with --base-href option set to your desired base path as shown below.
        ng serve -o --base-href /emp/
   -->
  <base href="/">
